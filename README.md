## Description
Want a quick and easy way to create an SVG logo? Try out my SVG Logo Maker! As a user, you will be prompted to input your 3 letter word (which will throw an alert if you exceed that 3 character limit), your preferred shape color, the shape that you want to use based off of the 3 choices provided, and then the text color of your choice. Both the shape and the text color can take in the color word or hexidecimal values. Once you've followed each prompt, your SVG logo will be automatically generated in the logos.svg file!
